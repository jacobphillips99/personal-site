      'Hi, I\'m Jacob. I work on applying machine learning solutions to the real world. I graduated from MIT with a B.S. in Computer Science in February 2021 and a M.Eng. in Computer Science in February 2022. I\'m interested in computer vision for autonomous robitics, fairness and bias in AI, and AGI alignment.',

      'I started at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the fall of 2017, primarily interested in computer science and robotics. I conduced research first under Nick Roy in the Robust Robotics Group and for the rest of my time at MIT under Daniela Rus in the Distributed Robotics Lab. My coursework focused primarily on machine learning, especially computer vision and control for autonomous cars, drones, and manipulator robots.',
      'I graduated early in February 2021 with a B.S. in 6-3 (Computer Science and Engineering) and began my Master of Engineering with Daniela Rus. I developed algorithmic techniques for mitigating bias in time-series models during training for applications in language and financial market forecasting. I submitted my thesis "Unsupervised Latent Debiasing of Time-Series Models" and graduated in February 2022.',

While at MIT, I completed most of a Ancient and Medieval History major before graduating early to start my master\'s. My courses and interest focus mostly on ancient Greece and Rome alongside early Christianity. I\'ve been lucky enough to travel parts of Athens, Rome, and some early Christian cathedrals. I\'m always looking for new books or podcasts on this time period.',

I raced mostly the 200 and 500 Freestyle, occassionally branching up to the 1000 and 1650. I ran a half-marathon once and massively regretted it. I like to hike and have done a few 14ers in Colorado and want to someday do the Tour Du Mont Blanc. I recently picked up skiing and have gotten pretty adept at falling down the mountain miles behind my friends.',
